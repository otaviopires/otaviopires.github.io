	<h1>About me</h1>


	<h2>Education</h2>
	<p>
	I've been studying technology since 2011, floating through computer networking, servers, scripting programming, web/mobile development, databases and devOps.<br>
	Currently I'm working as a .NET System Analyst at <a href="https://www.tricard.com.br/" target="_blank">Tricard</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	I did an scholarship program at the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">University of Toronto - Mississauga</a>, Canada, and took some courses in the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> major, besides an academic writing course, focusing on scientific articles production.
  </p>

	<p>
	I've graduated at the <a href="https://www.quixada.ufc.br/" target="_blank">Federal University of Ceará</a> in Brazil under the major of <a href="https://rc.quixada.ufc.br/" target="_blank">Technology in Computer Networks</a>.
	<br>
	Most of the knowledge I acquired through the years was self-taught, researching on the internet, practicing tutorials, chatting with friends, and hands on trying, failing and trying again.
	</p>


	<h2>Experience</h2>
	<p>
	I started working at the age of 16 as an office assistant at the <a href="https://www.bnb.gov.br/" target="_blank">Northeast Bank of Brazil</a> (Banco do Nordeste do Brasil) in Fortaleza, CE.<br>
	From them on I've developed a enormous ability and ease with text editing and spreadsheet tools, being able to handle huge chunks of data, formulas and macros.
	</p>

	<p>
	I've also worked as an assistant for <a href="http://www.bancofiat.com.br/" target="_blank">Itau-Fiat bank</a> (BancoFiat Itaú), in a car dealership called <a href="https://www.icavelfiat.com.br/" target="_blank">Icavel</a>, where I was dealing directly with the customer service, helping them to choose the best offers and taxes for their financing.
	</p>

	<p>
	During my university years I've worked as autonomous IT technician for an outsourcing company, helping government agencies.<br>
	I've founded a startup project called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/autobootnetworks/" target="_blank">Autoboot</a>, which aimed to deliver IT services and consulting for business in the Northeast of Brazil. We wanted to provide complete assistance on technology management for these business, helping them on building and evolving their websites, apps, visual identity, marketing strategies, social networks presence, technological innovations, IT management and infrastructure.<br>
	As an exercise on web/mobile development I've also started several projects with friends, trying to create social media, dating and financing apps using Angular and Ionic technologies.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After finishing my degree I've moved to Uberlandia, MG to live near my family.<br>
	There I started working at <a href="https://www.algartelecom.com.br/empresas" target="_blank">Algar Telecom</a> as Support Analyst for products as such as Internet Link, VPN, LAN-to-LAN.<br>
	During my time there I had the opportunity to work on a side project as a developer for a small internal dashboard using Laravel, Google Charts Vagrant and Linux. It was a nice experience and it inspired me to continue studying web development.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the same period I've also started working part time at a software factory called <a href="https://crosoften.com/" target="_blank">CroSoften</a> as a Project Manager.<br>
	This was a very enriching experience as I had contact with many different technologies and approaches such as Java Spring, Apache Tomcat, Docker, Node.js, Angular 2+, React, React Native, Android, IOS, .NET Core, Linux Servers, Amazon AWS and Digital Ocean.<br>
	As a Project Manager I've had to wear many hats and deal with clients, designer, developer, define and meet deadlines and also perform some deployments and production tasks.<br>
	As I was working two jobs I eventually burned out and had to quit this position due to high levels of stress and commitment required.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Few months later a had the opportunity to join an ecommerce company called <a href="https://www.openk.com.br/" target="_blank">OpenK</a> as a .NET Web Developer.<br>
	I've managed to keep working at both positions (developer during the day and support at night) for some time but eventually I had to make a choice and I decided to continue working as a web developer since I was having so much fun with it.<br>
	At OpenK I had the opportunity of working on many technologies such as Ionic, FreeMarker, .NET Framework, .NET MVC, .NET WebForms, .NET WebApi, .NET WCF, .NET Core, Quartz, Solr, Docker, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and Shell Scripting.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After some time I received another opportunity to move to a new company called <a href="https://arpiatecnologia.com.br/" target="_blank">Arpia Technology and Innovation</a>, where I would broader my knowledge even further. At this new position I'd take many projects and work with other companies.<br>
	During this period I've worked with <a href="https://www.rioquente.com.br/" target="_blank">Rio Quente Resorts</a>, <a href="http://clarivi.com.br/" target="_blank">Clarivi - Agricultural Service</a>, <a href="http://www2.tribanco.com.br/lojista/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Tribanco</a>, <a href="https://www.tricard.com.br/" target="_blank">Tricard</a> and <a href="https://useunica.com.br/" target="_blank">Unica</a>.<br>
	I've worked with .NET technologies, Pentaho Data Integration, C#, VB.NET, Angular 8, React.js, Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase, Shell Scripting, Python and Java.
	</p>


	<h2>Passions</h2>
	<p>
	I started writing during college and created this personal blog called <a href="mundodeotavio.wordpress.com" target="_blank">mundodeotavio.wordpress.com</a>, which has many texts in English and Portuguese with the purpose of sharing my ideas, thoughts and observations about my favorite topics, allowing myself full text-creation freedom.
	</p>

	<p>
	I'm an assiduous reader and I'm always trying to keep myself updated on the innovations and subjects that I love and have great importance to me, such as good life, career, programming, self-development, entrepreneurship, music, philosophy, culinary and biographies.<br>
	I enjoy watching great movies, TV shows, YouTube channels and documentaries on the most diverse topics to enrich my repertoire of knowledge and opinions.
	</p>

	<p>
	Another old passion of mine is music.<br>
	I've been floating around the most diverse genres since I was a kid and I love stumbling upon something new that really catches me and draws my attention and curiosity.<br>
	Because of that love for music, I taught myself how to play the guitar.<br>
	Sometimes I attempt to compose songs and arrange them, but just as an amateur - They don't usually come as nice as I expected :(
	</p>

	<p>
	I practice meditation, yoga, Muay Thai and bike around a lot.<br>
	People usually say that I have a tremendous ease in learning and absorbing new things, and I feel pretty confident to talk or write on any topic.
	</p>
