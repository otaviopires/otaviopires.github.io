<div class="post">
  <p>Quoted from the book Business Model You by Alexander Osterwalder, Tim Clark, and Yves Pigneur:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company I started did research and market entry consulting for companies wanting to enter Asian markets, particularly Japan. After more than six years of ferociously hard work, we received a multi-million-dollar buyout offer. This was all new to me; when I started, I didn’t even know people sold companies.
<br /><br />
Anyway, I paid off three mortgages, maxed out the kids’ college funds, took the family on a great vacation, and invested the remainder to provide passive income. But like everyone else, I still faced the big question: What am I going to do with the rest of my life?
<br /><br />
In a way, that question grew tougher precisely because I’d been relieved of the pressing need to earn a living. Seeking answers sharpened my awareness that work is about more than achieving financial independence.
<br /><br />
I think most successful entrepreneurs feel the same way. I’ve talked with a lot of people who collectively have sold dozens of companies for amounts ranging from one to $40 million U.S. Not a single one ever mentioned “achieving financial independence” as their primary motivation for working.
<br /><br />
Fortune-seekers can rarely sustain their passion through the hard times. Successful enterprises are laser-focused on Value Provided to Customers. Entrepreneurship is not about you; it’s about effectively serving others.
<br /><br />
 — Carl James, Entrepreneur</p>

<p>This testimony hit me like a rock!</p>

<p>It’s not about you, it’s all about serving others. Providing great service to other people. Giving value.</p>

<p>If you are seeking money or financial freedom, you’ll never gonna get it! It’s a endless road to dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Find the one thing that you do with pleasure, even when times are harsh, and do it for the people, with passion and love.</p>

<p>All the rest comes with time.</p>
